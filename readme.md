# 99Tech Code Challenge #1 #

## Overview
This document provides instructions on how to set up, run, and test each problem's implementation. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed before running the solutions.

## Problem 4: Three Ways to Sum to N

The implementations of the three function is in the file solution.ts in the folder src.

I also developed a simple frontend for you to easy test the code. The set up is for that frontend code.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- TypeScript

### Setup
1. Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Ensure TypeScript is installed globally (if needed):
   ```sh
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

### Running the Solution
Execute the script using Node.js:
```sh
tsc problem4.ts && node problem4.js
```
If you run the frontend code, use this script:
```sh
npm run start
```

## Problem 5: A Crude Server

With this problem, I also developed a simple front end for you to test that beckend code easily.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Express.js

### Setup
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies (If you want to run the frontend code, navigate to the frontend folder and run this script too):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Ensure `nodemon` is installed for automatic reloading:
   ```sh
   npm install -g nodemon
   ```

### Running the Server
Start the server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
Start the frontend:
```sh
npm run start
```

## Problem 6: Architecture

### Description
This problem involves designing an architectural solution. No setup or testing is required as it is a conceptual design.
